  In this this project a physical helicopter model is controlled using different methods to obtain stability and easy controllability with a joystick. The control methods are all based on a linearized mathematical model of the system. Among them are feed forward control, monovariable feedback control, and feedback control using a linear quadratic regulator (LQR). The latter was done both with direct state feedback and with state estimation using a linear observer.
